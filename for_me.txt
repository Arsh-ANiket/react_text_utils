React Router Dom

General usage is to link one web page to another.

To import
            import {
                BrowserRouter as Router,
                Routes,
                Route,  
            } from "react-router-dom";

Syntax for routing

    <router>
        <routes>
            <route element={} />
        </routes>
    </router>

Element carries the normal js page that we bring in
                    element={<About/>}
